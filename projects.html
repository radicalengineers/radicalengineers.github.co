           <p>Would your project or organisation benefit from our technical expertise? Maybe you have been meaning to build out your website? Evolve from your MVP? Looking for help with the automation of tasks? We're here to help. Our community of volunteer designers, developers and general technologists are eager to get to work!</p>
           <p>We aim to provide radical organisations with hands-on technical support. We work with selected projects to understand their needs and constraints, design an initial approach to the problem and find them the (volunteer) developers and designers that can help make their projects a success.</p>
          </div>
           <p>We will soon be opening our call for projects for our sixth cohort. In the meantime, we are accepting advanced applications, so if your project could benefit from the help of a designer or developer, please apply by <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe79qgbrusuZyagN89oME_F7S9F6IGRRw7VhUTUc8he4dlBWQ/viewform"><strong>filling out our form.</a></p>

            <p>Radical Engineers supports organisations and projects with radical aims.</p>
            <p>By radical we mean system-changing:  faced with the threat of mass extinction, a warming globe and rising inequality, we cannot afford to merely fight symptoms, but have to instead radically rethink the economic and social systems that produce them.</p>
            <p>For instance, in addition to removing waste from the oceans, how can we ensure waste never reaches our oceans in the first place?  If you’re working on system-changing projects and are looking for technical support (in the broadest sense of the term), then we may be able to help!</p>

            <h3 class="responsive-h3">All sizes are welcome</h3>
              <p>We support organisations of all sizes, experience levels and types (e.g. NGO, charities, corporations).</p>
            <h3 class="responsive-h3">We are London-based, but you don’t have to be</h3>
              <p class="">If your organisation supports remote work, then so do we!</p>
